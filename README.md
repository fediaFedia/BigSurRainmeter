What is it?

It's a free Rainmeter Suite (https://www.rainmeter.net/), which, and I have heard is quite fantastic.
Dozens of beautiful Widgets with Small, Medium and Large sizes inspired by Apple's UI.

Give it a try to make your Windows (XP/Vista/7/8/10/11) Desktop look like macOS Tahoe!
__It also uses like 40-80MB of RAM and 0-1% CPU on my Core i5 Laptop, can't say the same about most Desktop Widgets.__
