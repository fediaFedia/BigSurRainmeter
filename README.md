BigSur 26 for Rainmeter
=======================
![Preview](https://github.com/fediaFedia/BigSurRainmeter/blob/main/preview.png)

What is it?
It's a Rainmeter Suite (https://www.rainmeter.net/), which, and I have heard is quite fantastic.
Dozens of beautiful Widgets with Small, Medium and Large sizes inspired by Apple's UI.

Give it a try to make your Windows (XP/Vista/7/8/10/11) Desktop look like macOS Tahoe!
__It also uses like 40MB of RAM and 0-1% CPU on my Core i5 Laptop, can't say the same about most Desktop Widgets.__
